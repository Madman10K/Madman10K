# Hey there :wave: 
I am Madman10K or IRL name Stanislav Vasilev, I am from Sofia, Bulgaria and I am currently 15 years old. I do C++ and ~~game dev~~ actually game dev is too easy so I am now making game engines. Anyway I am extra autistic which is obvious since I use gentoo as my daily driver OS. 

![gentoo](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.retro-arcade.net%2Fpictures%2Fpng%2Fgentoo-logo.png&f=1&nofb=1)

Continuing on I am also am a strong follower of the GNU religion

![GNU](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F2%2F22%2FHeckert_GNU_white.svg%2F200px-Heckert_GNU_white.svg.png&f=1&nofb=1)

So as I was saying in my past life a.k.a. from when I was 12 until 14 I did Unreal Engine game dev est. just after the release of 4.18

Anyway you might want to check my "company"(I don't own a company lol I am under 18) where I make my game engine and games.
